# UFOs

### Overview
The goal of this project is to build an HTML page using JavaScript that features a filterable table of UFO sightings.  The table will be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape. 

### Results
Users will enter text into text boxes to search for individual sightings using the filter criteria.  The text boxes with filter options and the default initial search are displayed below:

Upon entering at least one search criteria into the text box the results will be filtered to reflect that search. A search for triangular UFOs in the state of California is displayed below:

To reset the search all search criteria must be deleted from the text boxes then the cursor musty be clicked outsid eof the text boxes.
